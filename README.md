# Portfolio Site

This site was built with [NextJS](https://www.nextjs.org) and hosts my resume and contact information.

## 🚀 Quick start

```sh
# Run a development version of the project
npm run dev

# Build a production version
npm run build

# Serve the production version

All pushes to the `main` branch result in builds and automatic deployments.
